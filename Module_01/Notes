Cybersecurity Fundamentals

1. What is Cybersecurity?
Its the practice of protecting SYSTEMS, networks AND data from attacks, unauthorized access or damage. Not only preventing attacks but also 
to ensure that systems remain reliable, functional and secure even when under threat.

Cybersecurity involves:
> Securing devices like computers, smartphones, and servers
> Protecting networks from unauthorized access
> Preventing data breaches or leaks
> Monitoring and responging  to threats in real-time

==========================================================

2. Why Cybersecurity is Important?
As technology advances, the risk of cyberattacks increases. Personal data, business information and even national security can be at risk.
Cybersecurity is necessary to ensure privacy, integrity and availability of information and systems.

Key points:
> Cybercrime is on the rise
> Personal and corporate data breaches can lead to significant financial loss and reputation damage
> Cybersecurity also ensures confidence in digital systems, which is essential for the economy

==========================================================

3. Core Concepts in Cybersecurity
Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA Triad)

The CIA Triad is the foundational model for understanding cybersecurity.
> Confidentiality: Ensuring that data is accessible only to authorized individuals. Encryption is a common method for ensuring confidentiality
> Integrity: Ensuring that data remains unaltered and accurate. Hashing is often used to ensure
> Availability: Ensuring that information and systems are accessible when needed. Backup systems, redundancy, and failover techniques are exam
ples of availability measures

Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risks
> Threat: A potential cause of harm. Example: Malware; a Hacker
> Vulnerability: A weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat. Example: Unpatched software
> Risk: The likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability. Risk is typically calculated as Threat x Vulnerability

==========================================================

4. Types of Cybersecurity Attacks
There are various types of cyberattacks, each designed to exploit different vulnerabilities.

> Malware: SOFTWARE designed to HARM or EXPLOIT a system, such as viruses, worms, and trojans.
> Phishing: A technique used to trick users into disclosing sensitive information like passwords.
> Denial of Servise (DoS): Attacks that overwhelm systems, causing them to become unavailable to users.
> Man-in-the-middle (MitM): Intercepting and altering communications between two parties without them knowing.

==========================================================

5. Types of Hackers

> White Hat Hackers: Ethical hackers who test and improve security.
> Black Hat Hackers: Cybercriminals who exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes.
> Gray Hat Hackers: Hackers who operate in a legal gray area, sometimes testing vulnerabilities without malicious intent, but without authorization

==========================================================

6. Ethical Hacking
Ethical hacking is the practice of TESTING SYSTEMS for vulnerabilities with EXPLICIT PERMISSION from the owner.
The main goal is to identigy weaknesses so they can be fixed before they are exploited by malicious hackers.

> Penetration Testing (Pen Testing): A controlled and authorized attack on a system to find vulnerabilities.
> Red Teaming: Simulating a adversary's actions to assess the system's security posture.

==========================================================

7. Defensive Security vs Offensive Security

> Offensive Security: Also known as RED TEAMING, involves actively probing systems for vulnerabilities, much like a hacker would. This includes
penetration testing and exploiting weaknesses in a controlled manner.
> Defensive Security: Also known as BLUE TEAMING, involves defending systems from attacks by implementing security measures such as firewalls, 
intrusion detection systems and secure configurations.

==========================================================

8. The Role of Cybersecurity in Daily Life

> Personal Security: Protects your data, such as passwords, social media profiles and banking information.
> Corporate Security: Protects businesses from data breaches, financial losses and legal consequences.
> National Security: Secures infraestructure such as power grids, transportation systems and defense networks.

Cybersecurity has evolved into a critical aspect of modern society, as more and more personal, professional and governmental data is digitized.
