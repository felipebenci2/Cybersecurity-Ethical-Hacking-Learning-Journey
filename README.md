# Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking – Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured learning path in **Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking**, combining theory, hands-on practice, and Python-based security exercises.

The goal is to build **solid fundamentals**, develop **practical skills**, and maintain a **professional study standard**, similar to a formal training program.

---

## 🛡️ Study Rules & Methodology

- Each module contains:
  - **20 exercises**
    - 10 easy
    - 5 medium
    - 5 hard
  - **5 challenges**
  - **1 exam**
    - 7 multiple-choice questions
    - 3 practical exercises

- **Minimum passing score:** 80%
- Even with 80% or higher:
  - Any **critical security flaw** requires the module to be redone.

This ensures not only correctness, but **secure and reliable implementations**.
